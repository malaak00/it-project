                alt="eish-balady">
            <p>Bread is a vital component in many cuisines. Its role is often two-fold – not only is it an important
                part of the meal itself, but it often serves as a utensil or vessel in the consumption of food. Such is
                the case with Egyptian food and aish baladi.</p>
            <p>Aish baladi (or eish baladi) is the Egyptian version of pita bread. It’s made with 100% whole wheat flour
                baked at extremely hot temperatures. It’s baked several times a day in Cairo and eaten at every meal so
                you never have to settle for stale bread in Egypt.</p>
            <p>This type of flatbread has been produced since ancient Egyptian times. Back then, it was made with an
                ancient grain known as emmer wheat. Wild yeast would help the dough rise which would then be baked in
                traditional Egyptian clay ovens made with red mud from the Nile River.</p>
            <p>Since ancient times, aish baladi has been a cornerstone of Egyptian cuisine. In fact, you can tell just
                how important it is to Egyptian culture by its name. Baladi means “traditional” or “authentic” while
                aish means “life”. Consumed everyday across all social classes in Egypt, it’s something that Egyptians
                simply cannot live without.</p>

                alt="hummus">

            <p>If you’re looking for something delicious to pair with your aish baladi, then look no further than
                hummus. An Egyptian food favorite that’s popular throughout the Middle East, it refers to a type of
                savory dip made from cooked mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, garlic, cumin, and lemon juice.</p>

            <p>The word hummus means “chickpeas” in Arabic and is a shortened version of the dish’s full name ḥummuṣ bi
                ṭaḥīna, meaning “chickpeas with tahini”. The exact origins of the dish are unclear, but the earliest
                written recipes for a dish resembling hummus are recorded in cookbooks written in 13th century Cairo.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically eaten as an appetizer or dip, or as an accompaniment to other Egyptian dishes like falafel,
                hummus is usually served with pita bread and garnishes like olive oil, whole chickpeas, paprika, and
                herbs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Interestingly, records indicate that Egyptians from the 13th and 14th centuries enjoyed a version of the
                dish called hummus kasa, which means “crushed hummus”. It appears to be a chunkier, less blended version
                of hummus made with the addition of coarsely chopped nuts. You can click on the link for the recipe.

            <img src="https://www.willflyforfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/egyptian-food-baba-ghannouj.jpg.webp"
                alt="Baba Ghanoush">

            <p>
                Like hummus, baba ghanoush (or baba ghanouj) is one of the most popular dips served in Egyptian cuisine.
                Originally from Lebanon, it consists of mashed cooked eggplant blended with tahini, garlic, olive oil,
                lemon juice, herbs, and spices.
            </p>

            <p>
                What I love most about baba ghanoush is its deliciously smokey flavor derived from roasted eggplant.
                It’s made by broiling or roasting the eggplant over an open flame and then peeling and blending it with
                the rest of the ingredients.

            </p>

            <p>
                Baba ghanoush is typically served cold in Egypt, often as part of a mezze platter with pita bread or as
                a side dish with larger meals.

            <img src="https://www.willflyforfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/egyptian-food-ful-medames.jpg.webp"
                alt="Ful Medames">


            <p>
                Egyptian food gives vegetarians plenty to look forward to and ful medames may be one of the most
                delicious ones yet. An Egyptian national dish, it refers to a stew of creamy fava beans cooked with
                cumin, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, herbs, and spices.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ful medames (or foul mudammas) is an Egyptian food staple but it’s also popular in other countries
                throughout the Middle East, the Levant, and North Africa. Like aish baladi, it’s an everyday Egyptian
                dish that can be consumed at any time of the day – for late breakfast, lunch, or even dinner. Like
                hummus and baba ghanoush, ful medames is typically eaten as a dip with warm pita bread.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ful medames is typically made with fūl ḥammām or “bath beans” but it can be made with other types of
                fava beans as well like fūl rūmī (European broad beans) and fūl baladī (country beans).
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s interesting to learn that in the Middle Ages, the cooking of fava beans for ful medames was
                monopolized by people living around the Princess Baths in Cairo, a public bath near the Mosque of Sultan
                al-Muayyad. During the day, bath attendants would stoke fires to heat huge pots of bath water called
                qidras. After the bath closed at night, the fires would continue to burn so they’d simmer fava beans in
                the qidras and sell them the next morning.

                alt="Ta’ameya">

            <p>
                Falafel is typically thought of as a Middle Eastern food (the fight about the country where it
                originated continues), but Egypt has its own version using dried fava beans rather than dried chickpeas.
                A medley of fresh herbs – parsley, dill and cilantro, along with onion, garlic, ground cumin and
                coriander – round out the ingredients list. Fava bean balls can be rolled in sesame seeds after frying.
                Pita bread (of course) makes for a perfect accompaniment as does tahini. Ta’ameya may be plated
                alongside a tomato and cucumber salad.

                alt="Molokhia">

            <p>
                Molokhia (or mulukhiyah, molokheyya) refers to both the Egyptian soup and the leafy vegetable used to
                make it. Like ful medames and koshari, it’s classic comfort food in Egypt and considered by many to be
                an Egyptian national dish.
            </p>

            <p>
                Molokhia is made with the leaves of the Corchorus plant, a leafy shrub commonly known as jute mallow,
                Jew’s mallow, or nalta jute. Aside from Egypt, it’s used in the cuisines of many other countries like
                Tunisia, Kenya, Haiti, and the Philippines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Egyptian molokhia is made with finely chopped jute leaves boiled in chicken broth with sauteed garlic,
                coriander, and seasonings. When cooked, molokhia takes on a somewhat slimy viscosity similar to okra.
                The soup is typically served with rice or Egyptian flatbread and is often paired with meat dishes like
                roasted chicken, rabbit, or seafood.
            </p>

            <p>
                Molokhia is a dish that many Egyptians grew up eating. According to this Egyptian food blogger, it’s
                used by many mothers to introduce new vegetables into their children’s diet. Most Egyptian kids take to
                molokhia from an early age so mothers would hide finely chopped vegetables like carrots, broccoli, peas,
                and beans in their mound of molokhia and rice. Sneaky!

            <p>
                Bamya refers to a type of Egyptian stew made with okra and lamb simmered in a tomato sauce with onions,
                garlic, peppers, cilantro, and spices. It’s popular throughout the Mediterranean and the Levant where it
                exists in many variations. Bamya in Arabic means “okra”.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bamya is a common dish in Egypt. It can be made with or without meat though many versions will contain
                some type of protein, usually lamb or beef. It’s often served with white rice or pita bread and a
                squeeze of lemon

            <p>
                Kofta (or kefta) refers to a family of meatball or meatloaf dishes popular throughout the Levant, North
                Africa, the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and the Indian subcontinent. In Egypt, they’re typically made
                with different types of seasoned ground meat but they can be made with other ingredients as well like
                fish and vegetables. Kofta can be formed into balls, patties, or cigars and cooked in any number of
                ways.
            </p>

            <p>
                Kofta kebabs are skewered and grilled koftas. Recipes vary but they’re typically made with a mixture of
                ground beef and ground lamb with onions, garlic, and a host of herbs and spices like parsley, mint,
                sumac, nutmeg, cardamom, allspice, cumin, and paprika.
            </p>
            <p>
                The meat mixture is molded over skewers and then grilled on each side for about four minutes. When
                ready, they can be eaten with white rice or pita bread and served with any choice of sides, salads, and
                dips.

            <p>
                Shawarma is one of my all-time favorite street foods. It’s a Levantine Arab dish that’s hugely popular
                as street food in Cairo and throughout Egypt. It’s widely consumed throughout the Middle East and beyond
                and was even famously referenced in an Avengers post-credit scene.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shawarma consists of thinly shaved pieces of grilled meat sliced from a rotating vertical rotisserie.
                It’s typically served in pita bread as a pocket sandwich or wrap with onions, tomatoes, cucumbers,
                french fries, tahini sauce, and hot sauce.
            </p>

            <p>
                To make shawarma, thin slices of heavily-spiced meat – usually beef, chicken, lamb, or mutton – are
                pierced and stacked onto a vertical skewer. Larger pieces are layered on top to create a cone-like stack
                measuring about 60 cm (20 in) high.
            </p>

            <p>
                A motorized spit then turns the stack against a vertical heating element to slowly roast the meat in its
                own juices and fat. It’s delicious and an absolute must-try in Egypt.

                Kebda Eskandarani is typically enjoyed as a sandwich but it can be eaten on its own as well with white

                New Yorkers may find this next dish a little tough to stomach. Pigeons are viewed as pests in some
                cities but in Egypt, it’s considered a delicacy. Hamam mahshi refers to a traditional Egyptian dish made
                with stuffed squab or young domestic pigeon.

            <p>
                In Egypt, mother pigeons fatten up their young in dovecotes with a nutritious secretion called crop
                milk. To make hamam mahshi, Egyptian cooks select the fattest 6-week old squabs. Any older and the meat
                becomes too tough and muscular, similar to veal becoming beef.

            </p>

            <p>
                To prepare, the squab is stuffed with a mixture of rice, freekeh (cracked wheat), onions, giblets, nuts,
                and spices. The bird is grilled or roasted on a spit before being served on a bed of cracked wheat.
                Hamam mahshi is traditionally a dish reserved for special occasions in Egypt, but these days, it
                shouldn’t be too hard to find on Egyptian restaurant menus.

                This next dish may not look like it belongs on an Egyptian food guide, but makarōna beshamel is an
                extremely popular dish in Egyptian cuisine. It’s essentially the Egyptian version of pastitsio, a Greek
                baked pasta dish made with ground meat and béchamel sauce. Makarōna beshamel, in Egyptian Arabic, means
                “macaroni with béchamel”.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recipes vary but makarōna beshamel is typically made with penne or macaroni baked with bechamel and a
                minced meat sauce made from ground beef, onions, tomato sauce, and seasonings. It’s a common sight at
                Egyptian banquets and gatherings, especially over the holidays.

            </p>

            <p>
                Makarōna beshamel was introduced to Egypt in the 19th century by Greek and Italian immigrants. Today,
                it’s one of the most beloved comfort foods in Egyptian cuisine.
